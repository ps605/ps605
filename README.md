### Hi,

I am a biomechanical scientist with over 7 years of international work experience in project management, strategic planning, research and development. Observant problem solver with expertise in orthopaedic technology and injury analysis. Proven ability translating complex engineering and scientific methods into practical solutions for research, military and sport problems. Successful disseminator of scientific evidence with 7 peer-reviewed publications and over 15  podium presentations.

On this repository I store some public and private codebases I have developed since my PhD. They are mostly written in Matlab and Python and focus on three main areas:

## 1) Cervical spine injury mechanism analysis

Main development included:
- Genetic Algorithm for viscoelastic parameter identification of IVD joints during dynamic impacts
- Forward Dynamic musculoskeletal simulations to estimate spinal joint internal loading 

## 2) Reverse total Shoulder Arthroplasty (RTSA) 
- Computational geometry analyses of scapula statistical shape models (SSM)
- Musculoskeletal model definition and handling in Matlab to handle SSM geometry input
- Predictive simulations of musculoskeletal model reaching tasks to assess RTSA position effectiveness
- Launch of modelling and simulation pipeline on Federal Canadian computing clusters (Cedar, Narval)

## 3) Computer vision analysis of ADL
- Codebase for analysing computer vision ML model outputs for clinical and research practices
